Small example for bug report

It appears that Meteor's implementation of dynamic import does not support full URLs (from other web sites).

To see the problem, clone the repository, cd to the repository directory, and run `meteor`.

View the app, using Chrome, with Developer Tools open, looking at the console log. The web page describes the problem.
